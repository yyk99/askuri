<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><P>The main thing to remember about frequencies is that only one person
can transmit on a certain frequency at one time. Before turning on your transmitter at
the flying field, it is your responsibility to make certain that no one else is operating
on the same frequency!</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><P><B>FREQUENCIES FOR NON-FLYING MODELS: </B><BR>
Apart from the above listed model aircraft frequencies in the 72 MHz band,
the FCC has allocated 30 frequencies in the 75 MHz band for the exclusive
use of R/C'ers who build model cars, boats, or any other type of non-flying &quot;surface&quot;
vehicle. The FCC differentiates between &quot;aircraft&quot;
and &quot;surface&quot; models because of the potential for radio interference
between the two distinct classes of R/C models. For instance, an R/C car being operated
in someone's driveway could cause an R/C airplane being flown several miles away,
out of the car driver's sight, to fly out of control and injure someone, if they were on
the same frequency. To avoid possible interference of this kind, &quot;aircraft&quot;
and &quot;surface&quot; models are required by law to operate on entirely different frequencies.
It is very important that you are aware of this difference and always use an approved frequency
in all of your R/C models.
<P><B>It is dangerous, as well as against the law, to use an aircraft radio in a surface model,
and vice versa!</B></FONT><BR>

</TABLE>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Additionally, there are six frequencies available in the 27 MHz
band that the FCC allows any type of R/C model to use. However,
we strongly discourage the use of the 27 MHz frequencies for model aircraft use because
of the great probability of radio interference from the thousands of inexpensive,
ready-to-use R/C toy cars that are sold on these frequencies.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><P><B><I>CHANNEL NUMBERS VS. NUMBER OF CHANNELS</I></B></FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">The channel number assigned to the frequency shouldn't be confused with the number of &quot;channels&quot;, or controls, that your radio can operate on the model. It takes a separate channel to operate each one of the model's controls! For instance, an R/C model that has the same 4 primary controls that a real airplane has would need a 4-channel radio system - one channel to operate the ailerons, one to operate the elevator, one to operate the rudder, and one to operate the throttle. On the other hand, some R/C models, such as the famous SIG KADET SENIOR, are specially designed to fly with only three-channel control (rudder, elevator, and throttle). Also, many R/C sailplanes fly beautifully on only two channels (rudder and elevator). Highly advanced R/C scale models will often use the 4 primary channels plus a 5th, 6th, or 7th channel to operate such features as retractable landing gear, flaps, bomb drops, etc.</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
Generally the channels available on a model airplane radio are utilized as follows:</FONT><BR>
<TABLE align="CENTER" width="60%">
<TR><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>1 channel radio</B> - rudder control only</FONT>
<TR><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>2 channel radio</B> - rudder and elevator control, or aileron and elevator control</FONT>
<TR><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>3 channel radio</B> - rudder, elevator, and motor control,</FONT>
<TR><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>4 channel radio</B> - rudder, elevator, ailerons, and motor control</FONT>
<TR><TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><B>5 - 7 channel radio </B>- rudder, elevator, ailerons, and motor control plus options
such as retracts, flaps, bombs, etc.</FONT>
</TABLE>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
We recommend that your first radio be a 4-channel system! If you are like most people starting
in the hobby, you will eventually want to fly models with complete 4-channel
controls, even if your trainer only needs 3 channels.
With a 4-channel radio you will have the capability to move on to more advanced
models after you've learned to fly. You can always use 2 or 3 of the channels to
fly simple models, and still have the additional channels available when you
want to fly a full-house airplane. In the long run it will be cheaper to buy
a 4-channel radio right at the start than to get a 2 or 3-channel radio and then
try to sell it later when you want to upgrade to a 4-channel model. Not only that,
but most 2 - 3 channel radios come with dry-cell (throw-away) batteries, while 4-channel
radios normally have rechargeable nicads. That alone is usually worth the difference in
price between a 2 - 3 channel radio system and a 4-channel radio system.

sailplane that is happiest when gently floating in the
lift of passing thermals. Like most gliders,
the Riser 100 uses two channels to control the rudder

may be added to operate spoilers on the top of the wing.</B></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
Model aircraft transmitters have become fairly standardized over the years in the layout of the control sticks on the front of the box. It wasn't always that way. In the early days of R/C, many different stick arrangements were tried in an effort to make it easier to fly R/C. Today there are basically three transmitter stick arrangements in use around the world. For a typical 4-channel model airplane, here is how they work:</FONT><BR>
<P>
<TABLE width="60%" border="0" align="CENTER">
<TR>
<TD valign="top"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
MODE-I<TD> - <TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
Right stick operates the ailerons and throttle. Left stick operates the
rudder and elevator.</FONT></TD>
<TR>
<TD valign="top"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
MODE-II<TD> - <TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
Right stick operates the ailerons and elevator. Left stick
operates the rudder and throttle.</FONT></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD valign="top"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
MODE-III</FONT><TD> - <TD><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
Single stick operates the ailerons, elevator, and rudder. Lever on side
of transmitter operates the throttle.</FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Mode-II is by far the most popular method in the United States!
This grouping of the ailerons and elevator on the right stick very closely duplicates the
control stick arrangement in a full-size airplane. Consequently, most people feel
Mode-II is a more natural way to fly R/C than either of the other modes. The vast majority
of the R/C fliers in the U.S. fly Mode-II, and we advise you to learn that way.
All of the radios you look at in the hobby shop will undoubtably be Mode-II,
the other types must be special ordered.</FONT>
